        <p>When viewing in a mobile web browser, the menu dropdown menu
        at the top right of the screen can be used to navigate throughout the site. When using Zleep
        on a display &gt;770 pixels wide, the menu dropdown is augmented with standalone buttons for each application feature.</p></div><!-- /.row -->

        <p>Your next alarm (in chronological order) will be displayed on this screen.
        If no alarms have been set, the "Create Alarm Now!" button will appear; which when pressed, will navigate to the <i>My Alarms</i> page. </p></div><!-- /.row -->

        The <i>My Alarms</i> page allows users to edit existing alarms and create new alarms using our sleep-science formula for optimal REM sleep. The phone number used by any alarms set on this page is determined by the number stored in the user's <i>Account Settings</i> page.
